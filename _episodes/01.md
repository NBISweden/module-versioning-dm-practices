    df_print: paged
objectives:
- Get a mental representation for commits and branches.
- Understand the difference between forks and clones.
- Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
keypoints:
- Use a version control system to manage snapshots of your data, scripts, documents,
  manuscripts and more!
- Creating snapshots allow you to go back to the same version as was published, shared
  with a collaborator or used in an analysis
- Keeping a record of changes allows you track down problems and selectively undo/redo

- How not to worry about making changes to a project?
- What is version control?
- What is git and github?

> ### Introduction to the lesson
> This tutorial provides a brief but hands-on introduction to the concept of version control, Git in RStudio, and
> GitHub. Git is a version control system which allows files and data to be tracked and synchronized,
> which allows collaboration and reproducibility.
> GitHub is a popular website that stores these repositories.
>
> **This tutorial avoids using the command line.** Instead, we will practice the basics of Git using Rstudio and later on we will also introduce GitHub. In many cases, this is enough. Git in Rstudio and GitHub provide collaboration tools to all kinds of projects, and there are all kinds of good ways to use it.
>
> This serves as an introduction to Git. After this lesson, you will both be able to use Git, and feel much more confident taking a command-line Git course such as [CodeRefinery’s git-intro course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
>
> What we will not cover
> * Command line interface
> * Cloning using SSH protocol and SSH keys
> * Rebasing and squashing
> * Many Git tricks which can be explored later
{: .callout}

> ## Why GitHub?
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use CodeRefinery’s [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).

## Version Control Systems
(13 min teaching) [fair-bio-practice](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/11-version-control/index.html#how-version-control-systems-work:~:text=Solution-,Version%20Control%20Systems,-(13%20min%20teaching)

> ## How Version Control Systems Work
> 
> A version control system is a tool that keeps track of file changes for us and helps us version and merge our files. 
> It allows you to decide which changes make up the next version, called a commit, and keeps useful metadata about them. 
> The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. 
>
> A version control system stores snapshots of a project's files in a
> repository. Users modify their working copy of the project and then
> save changes to the repository when they wish to make a permanent record
> and/or share their work with colleagues. The version control system
> automatically records when the change was made and by whom along with
> the changes themselves.
>
> Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.
>
> Crucially, if several people have edited files simultaneously, the
> version control system will detect the collision and require them to
> resolve any conflicts.

Tool-based version control has several benefits over manual version
control:

*   Instead of requiring users to backup copies of the whole
project, version control safely stores just enough information to
allow old versions of files to be re-created on demand.

*   Instead of relying on users to choose sensible names for backup
copies the version control system timestamps all saved changes
automatically.

*   Instead of requiring users to be disciplined about completing the
changelog version control systems prompt them every time a change
is saved. They also keep a 100% accurate record of what was
*actually* changed, as opposed to what the user *thought* they
changed, which can be invaluable when problems crop up later.

*   Instead of simply copying files to remote storage, version control
checks to see whether doing that would overwrite anyones work.
If so, they identify conflicts and merge changes.

We believe that the best tools for tracking changes are the version
control systems that are used in software development such as Git. 
Git keeps track of what was changed in a file
when and by whom and it can synchronize changes to a central server (GitHub) so that
many users can manage changes to the same set of files. 

Simplifying Git is a local program (like Word) that runs on your machine and knows how to track changes.
Github is an online system that can communicate with Git and propagate your changes to other computers 
(like OneDrive can do for Word documents).

Keeping track of changes that you or your collaborators make to data and
software is a critical part of research. Being able to reference or
retrieve a specific version of the entire project aids in
reproducibility for you leading up to publication, when responding to
reviewer comments, and when providing supporting information for
reviewers, editors, and readers.


- Version control is a tool that can **record snapshots of a project**.
- You can think of version control like regularly taking a photo of your work
  (movie sets take regular polaroids to be able to recreate a scene the next day).

Snapshots (**commits**) in the [nf-core/viralrecon](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/) repository.



### What we typically like to snapshot

- Software (this is how it started but Git/GitHub can track a lot more)
- Scripts
- Documents (plain text file much more suitable than Word documents)
- Manuscripts (Git is great for collaborating/sharing LaTeX manuscripts)
- Configuration files
- Website sources
- Data


### Why are snapshots valuable? Reproducibility!

- We can always go back if we make a mistake.
- We have the means to refer to a well-defined version of a project when sharing, collaborating, and publishing.
- If we discover a problem, we can find out when it was introduced.


## Version control with Git and GitHub

### Difference between [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com)

**Git**
- Tool that can record and synchronize snapshots.
- Not the only tool that can record snapshots (other popular tools are
[Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)).
- Not only a tool but also a format that can be read by many different tools.

**GitHub**
- Service that provides hosting for Git repositories with a nice web interface.
- Not the only service that provides this (other popular services are
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)).

**GitHub Desktop**
- Graphical user interface to Git and GitHub which runs locally on your computer.
- There are other tools that can do this too (e.g. [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).


### Commits, branches, repositories, forks, clones

- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
- **branch**: Independent development line, often we call the main development line `main`.
- **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a sticky note that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. `phd-printed` or `paper-submitted`).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
- **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your
  copy (fork) stays on GitHub and you can make changes to your copy.

> ## Why using repositories?
>
> - All changes are recorded.
> - We do not have to send changes via email.
> - We can experiment with several ideas which might not work out (using branches).
> - Several people can work on the same project at the same time (using branches).
> - We do not have to wait for others to send us "the latest version" over email.
> - We do not have to merge parallel developments by hand.
> - Group-based access model where shared access is the default, instead of
>   everything fundamentally owned by individuals who manage sharing as-needed:
>   with Git you can easily have collaboration be the default.
> - It is possible to serve websites directly from a repository.

title: "Version control systems"
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
objectives:
- Get a mental representation of version control and its benefits.
- Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
keypoints:
- Use a version control system to manage snapshots of your data, scripts, documents,
  manuscripts and more!
- Creating snapshots allow you to go back to the same version as was published, shared
  with a collaborator or used in an analysis
- Keeping a record of changes allows you track down problems and selectively undo/redo
questions:
- How not to worry about making changes to a project?
- What is version control?
- What is Git and GitHub?

> ### Introduction to the lesson
> This tutorial provides a brief but hands-on introduction to the concept of version control, Git and
> GitHub. Git is a command-line based version control system which allows files and data to be tracked and synchronized,
> facilitating collaboration and reproducibility.
> GitHub is a popular website that stores Git repositories.
>
> **This tutorial avoids using the command line.** Instead, we will practice the basics of Git using Git in RStudio. We will also introduce GitHub and show how the website can be used. Later on, we will practise how to manage a local git repository together with the remote repository on GitHub. In many cases, this is enough. Git in Rstudio and GitHub provide collaboration tools to all kinds of projects, and there are all kinds of good ways to use it.
>
> This tutorial serves as an introduction to version control and Git. After this lesson, you will both be able to use Git, and feel much more confident taking a command-line Git course such as [CodeRefinery’s git-intro course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/). Acknowledgments to

> * Rebasing and squashing
> * Many Git tricks which can be explored later

> ## Why GitHub?
>
> We will do an exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use CodeRefinery’s [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).

## Introduction to Version Control

When making changes to files and their content, we risk losing previous content or entire files by overwriting them, hoping they will not be needed. Additionally, there may be unintended side effects, such as breaking analysis pipelines when renaming files. It can also be challenging to manage multiple changes across different files as a cohesive unit, such as updating a figure and its accompanying description. Furthermore, when collaborating with others, it is necessary to coordinate and resolve conflicts arising from concurrent changes made by collaborators.

Addressing these issues by tracking changes is called **version control**.

> ### How Version Control Systems Work
> 
> A version control system is a valuable tool that helps us manage file changes by tracking and organizing them. 
> It allows us to create and merge different versions of files, known as commits, while also storing relevant metadata. 
> These commits and their associated metadata collectively form a repository, 
> which serves as a comprehensive record of the entire history of changes for a specific project.
>
> Users modify their working copy of the project and then
> save changes to the repository when they wish to make a permanent record.
> The system automatically captures and logs the time and date, author, and specific changes made,
> providing a comprehensive history of the project's evolution.
>
> Repositories can be easily updated and shared among multiple users on different computers, 
> allowing for seamless collaboration and coordination among team members.
>
> Importantly, in case multiple individuals have made edits to the same files simultaneously, 
> the version control system will identify and flag any conflicts, prompting users to reconcile and resolve 
> these conflicts before merging changes.

### Version control system vs. Manual versioning

To highlight some benefits of version control systems vs. manual version
control:

* Instead of mandating users to create backups of the entire project, 
version control systems securely stores only the necessary information 
to recreate previous versions of files on demand.

* Instead of depending on users to come up with meaningful names for backup copies, 
the version control system automatically timestamps all saved changes, 
ensuring efficient tracking and organization of revisions.

* Instead of requiring users to consistently update a changelog, 
version control systems prompt users to document changes 
every time a modification is saved. They also keep a 100% accurate record of what was
*actually* changed, as opposed to what the user *thought* they
changed. This can be immensely valuable for troubleshooting and issue resolution when problems crop up later.

* Instead of blindly copying files to remote storage, 
version control systems perform conflict checks to ensure that no one's work will be overwritten. 
If conflicts are detected, they are identified, making it easier to resolve and merge changes.

### What is Git and GitHub?

To put it simply, **Git** is a software that you install on your computer, similar to Word and Excel, which helps you keep track of changes in files. It acts like a virtual folder called a repository where all changes are stored as snapshots called commits.

On the other hand, **GitHub** is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for collaborative software development, where you can store and manage your Git repositories online. GitHub acts as a remote repository that can communicate with your local Git repository, allowing you to push changes from your local repository to GitHub and pull changes from GitHub to your local repository. It also provides additional features such as issue tracking, code reviews, and collaboration tools, making it popular among developers for hosting and sharing their code with others. Just like OneDrive can synchronize Word and Excel documents across multiple devices, GitHub can propagate changes made in Git repositories across different computers and provide a centralized location for collaboration and version control in a group setting.

**In research**, it is vital to keep track of changes made to data and software by you or your collaborators. This allows you to easily reference or retrieve a specific version of the entire project, which promotes reproducibility. This becomes especially important during various stages of the research process, such as leading up to publication, addressing reviewer comments, and providing supporting information to reviewers, editors, and readers. Keeping a record of changes made ensures that the research findings can be validated, collaborated upon, and documented accurately, enhancing the reliability and transparency of the research work.

> ## Exercise 2: Using Version Control System (5 min)
>
> Now that you have been introduced theoretically to version control systems, we want you to go through these five reasons to use a version control system in research:
>
> *   Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.
> *   Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.
> *   Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.
> *   Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly.
> *   Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance.
> The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project.
>
> Which two are the most important for you?

> ## Version Control System and FAIR
> Looking at the reasons to use a version control system in research, 
> how does using version control system help in being FAIR?
>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> *   Online respository is a Findable and Accessible resource (also Trackable).
>> *   Online repositories are also interoperable since they can be accessed from anywhere (with internet) and are not restricted to your local hard drive.
>> *   The 'telling story' and being able to travel back in time helps in reuse and reproducibility.

## Extra Material

### Commits, branches, repositories, forks, clones

- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
- **branch**: Independent development line, often we call the main development line `main`.
- **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a sticky note that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. `phd-printed` or `paper-submitted`).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
- **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your
  copy (fork) stays on GitHub and you can make changes to your copy.

> ## Why using repositories?
>
> - All changes are recorded.
> - We do not have to send changes via email.
> - We can experiment with several ideas which might not work out (using branches).
> - Several people can work on the same project at the same time (using branches).
> - We do not have to wait for others to send us "the latest version" over email.
> - We do not have to merge parallel developments by hand.
> - Group-based access model where shared access is the default, instead of
>   everything fundamentally owned by individuals who manage sharing as-needed:
>   with Git you can easily have collaboration be the default.
> - It is possible to serve websites directly from a repository.
